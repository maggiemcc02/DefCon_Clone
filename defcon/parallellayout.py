"""
Some utility functions that map teams to ranks and ranks to teams.

The default strategy is to group ranks sequentially, i.e. if teamsize = 4
and the ranks are

[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

then the teams will be

[10, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1]

but this may not be optimal on your machine. If you want to implement a different
layout, just change these two functions.
